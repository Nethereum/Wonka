This version of the Wonka Engine for Ethereum (i.e., written in Solidity) is an attempted implementation of the [Diamond](https://github.com/mudgen/Diamond) standard.

It is currently under construction, so it's not a reliable version.  The [original implementation](https://github.com/Nethereum/Wonka/tree/master/Solidity/WonkaEngine) is the stable one.
