This version of the Wonka Engine for Ethereum (i.e., written in Solidity) is a Hardhat project whose aim is to be more aligned with deployment to the mainnet.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract and a test for that contract.

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
