This version of the Wonka Engine for Ethereum (i.e., written in Solidity) is a Hardhat project whose aim is to be more aligned with deployment to the mainnet.

It is currently under construction, so it's not a reliable version.  The [original implementation](https://github.com/Nethereum/Wonka/tree/master/Solidity/WonkaEngine) is the stable one.

Some scripts (such as ../WonkaEngine/tests/testwonka.01.js) might take some time to port, so that it makes use of the new deck (Ethers, Typescript, etc.).
